# How to learn to program Linux for high performance

Some in-depth resources for the performance intrepid adventurer.

## Description
I would like to share some good resources on high performance programming in CPU's, more specifically on Linux and C, but some resources on GPU programming will also be given.

To program for high performance we need to have some knowledge of a low level language, like C, C++, Rust or Odin and as a second candidate a language like Julia for mathematical processing.

## Programming in C++

I will not suggest any book on C++, because I don't like any of the current books on C++, and feel that current C++ standard is a little bit feature creep. In that, practically no one really knows every feature of C++ and only knows a little subset of it, because it is so large, and growing so much in each standard edition, so full of small and intricate details. The problem is that the subset of C++ that person A knows, is normally different from the subset that person B knows.
